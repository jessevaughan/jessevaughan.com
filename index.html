			<h1>Jesse <br>Vaughan <span>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></h1>

			<p class="first">28 year old front end developer and designer originally from Baltimore, Maryland currently living and working in San Francisco, California.</p>

			<p>I have been professionally involved in the web industry for over four years and have a passion for designing attractive websites, developing clean code and working as hard as possible to create a great product.</p>

			<p>After getting a start in agency web design and development just outside of Baltimore, I decided to pack up and accept a new role of marketing web developer in the enterprise B2B cloud software space of San Francisco. I admit that the transition was a bit jarring but the experience has led me to confidently build my codebase knowledge as well as establish a strong undestanding of corporate enterprise marketing. My daily tasks have included not only maintaining and creating front facing web products but also developing internal brands, contributing to online marketing strategies, and improving online demand generation through copororate web presence.</p>

			<p>My development strengths are primarily in HTML/CSS, javascript, jQuery and PHP with heavy knowledge of Sass, LESS, Git, and multiple deployment platforms (Capistrano, Beanstalk, DeployHQ, etc.) and a basic understanding of Rails, JSON and working with APIs. I am comfortable adapting to development workflows as well as creating custom alternatives for various team sizes. I have rolled out complex standalone dynamic web environments and have worked with several content management systems including ExpressionEngine, WordPress, and my current favorite Statamic.</p>

			<p>I acquired my undergraduate degree is in Visual Arts concentrating in Graphic Design and Photography from the University of Maryland Baltimore County. While my most recent experience is primarily in front-end development, I still maintain a strong design sense and draw inspiration from any and all cutting edge web-based media. In my freetime, I enjoy traveling as much as possible (both locally and globally), writing whenever the opportunity presents itself, staying up to date in fashion and culture, reading as many books as I can, creating DJ mixes for friends, and ocassionally sulking.</p>

			<p>I am currently employed, but am always open to meeting new people and to new opportunities. If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to <a href="mailto:jesse.s.vaughan@gmail.com">email me</a>.

			<blockquote>"I feel that life is divided into the horrible and the miserable. That's the two categories. The horrible are like, I don't know, terminal cases, you know, and blind people; crippled. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. And the miserable is everyone else. So you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's very lucky, to be miserable." <br><span>- Alvy Singer <a href="http://houseofwoo.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dilbert.gif" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i></a></span></blockquote>
